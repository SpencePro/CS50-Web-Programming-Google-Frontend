# CS50 Google Frontend

### Description

This is a simple clone of the Google search, made using HTML5 and CSS3. It was made as an assignment for Harvard's CS50 Web 
Programming with Python and JavaScript online course. It was intended to be a simple frontend-only clone, intended to match as closely as possible the look of Google's own search page. 

There are three components to it:
1. Google search: this is the regular search function.
2. Image search: this is the image search, which has a different google search. 
3. Advanced search: this is a limited version of Google's advanced search function, which allows the user to search for queries that match all of the given terms, none of the given terms, any of the given terms, and/or an exact term.

All search functions were implemented in HTML alone, per the assignment instructions.
